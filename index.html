                <p>Compound interest is often called the eighth wonder of the world, and for good reason. It's the financial principle that can transform small, consistent investments into substantial wealth over time. Understanding how compound interest works is crucial for anyone looking to build long-term financial security.</p>

                <p>Unlike simple interest, which only earns returns on your initial investment, compound interest earns returns on both your principal and the interest that accumulates over time. This creates a snowball effect that accelerates your wealth growth exponentially.</p>

                <p>Consider this example: If you invest $1,000 at a 7% annual return, after 10 years you'd have $1,967. But if you consistently add just $100 monthly to that investment, you'd have $18,294 after the same period. The magic lies not just in the compounding, but in the consistency of contributions.</p>

                <p>The key factors that maximize compound interest are time, consistency, and rate of return. Starting early gives your money more time to grow, regular contributions feed the compounding machine, and finding investments with reasonable returns amplifies the effect.</p>

                <p>Don't let the complexity of financial markets intimidate you. Start small, be consistent, and let time work in your favor. Even modest amounts invested regularly can grow into substantial sums over decades, proving that patience and persistence are often more valuable than large initial investments.</p>

                    A first-generation Filipino American who didn't grow up with financial literacy or access to wealth. Instead of letting that hold me back, it fueled my determination to learn, to grow, and to make sense of a world that often feels complicated and closed off.
